            1:Use the async or defer attribute on your script tags: This will allow your HTML parser to continue parsing while your scripts are being downloaded.
                 Using async or defer will ensure that your page loads faster and your users don't have to wait for a script to download before they can interact with your page.

            2:Load scripts at the end of the body tag: If you are not using async or defer, 
                then the best practice is to load your scripts at the end of the body tag. This will ensure that your HTML is fully parsed before your scripts are executed.

            3:Use a separate file for your scripts: Keeping your scripts in a separate file makes it easier to manage and maintain your code. 
                It also allows for better code reuse across multiple pages.
