Hello, class. Today we will be learning how to use the verb. In the simple present we use the verb be to describe people and things. For example, he is tall or Toyota's are good cars. We also use it to say how we feel. For example, I am happy. And finally, we use it to describe nationality and job. For example, they are German.

00:00:41:07 - 00:01:24:10

She is a nurse. It is easy to form the verb in the simple present. For I use M for example. I am happy for you. We and they use are for example, they are Ethiopian for he or she. And it use is. For example, he is said to form a question with the verb be in the simple present, move the verb be to the beginning of the sentence.

00:01:25:06 - 00:02:34:08
Speaker 1
For example, I am happy because am I happy for you? We and they move. Are to the beginning of the sentence. They are Ethiopians becomes are they Ethiopians? Finally, for he she and it move is to the beginning of the sentence. For example, he is sad becomes is he sad to form a negative sentence in the simple present using the verb be simply add not after the verb the for example for I we say am not I am happy becomes I am not happy for you we and they they are Ethiopians becomes they are not Ethiopians.

00:02:35:02 - 00:11:50:06
Speaker 1
You add not after the verb be you add not after the word are they are not Ethiopians for he she and it add the word not after the word is he is sad becomes he is not said. Thank you for coming to class and make sure to do the activities that go with this video. I'll see you next time.

Hey, everybody. Today we will be learning about the simple past. We use the simple past to talk about finished events in the past. For example, I visited Lalibela last year. We also use the simple past to talk about a series of events. For example, I woke up, I ate breakfast and I walked to school. That is a series of three events and we use the simple past.

00:12:27:24 - 00:13:08:16
Speaker 1
Finally, we use the simple past to interrupt the past continuous. For example, when I was doing my homework, the phone rang. When I was doing my homework. Is the past continuous? The phone rang. Is an interruption. Forming this simple past is easy. We just take the base form and add ID. For example, I walked to school yesterday. Walk the base form becomes what?

00:13:09:06 - 00:13:57:17
Speaker 1
For verbs that end in a Y, remove the Y and then add IED. For example, I studied English yesterday. Study becomes study. Finally, if the word already ends in an E like the word live, just add a D. For example, I lived in France in 2008. Live becomes lived to form a question in the simple past. Start the question with the word did and change the main verb back to the base form.

00:13:58:14 - 00:14:21:19
Speaker 1
For example, you walked to school becomes did you walk to school? So did you want to? School is a mistake, you say. Did you walk to school? You walked to school becomes did you walk to school?
